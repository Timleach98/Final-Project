# How to Build Your Own Computer!
## Tim Leach Final Project INFOTC 1600
This tutorial is going to show the basics in building a computer. I have done this several times in my life and I think that it is an incredibly useful skill.
There is going to be a list of components needed in order to complete the build. This is a very general guide but will serve nonetheless. 
This guide will cater to most everyone as it is not relatively hard to build a computer, it is just like more expensive Legos!
